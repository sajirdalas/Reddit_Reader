This proyect is meant to be a web based Reddit reader better meant for small screens and touch interfaces.

The idea is for every post to be a "card" and every screen size has an adaptative number of cards.

The proyect is in a VERY early stage. The basic user interface is done and I am currently working on making it display Reddit content

Things to do next:
-Clicking on a post should open said post (Maybe in a webview?)
-Swipe left or right should load more posts
