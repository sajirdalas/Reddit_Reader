This proyect is meant to be a web based Reddit reader better meant for small screens and touch interfaces.

The idea is for every post to be a "card" and every screen size has an adaptative number of cards.

The proyect is in a VERY early stage. So far all I have done is play around with the user interface to make it adapt to every screen.

Things to do next:
-Make the adaptative interface work vertically
